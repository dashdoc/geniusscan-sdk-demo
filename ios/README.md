## Requirements

The Custom demo app supports iOS 13 and above.
The Simple demo app supports iOS 15 and above.

## Installation

2. Run `pod install` to install the SDK frameworks.

## Licensing

The Genius Scan SDK and plugins only work for **one minute per session** in trial mode. To test the scanner without restarting the demo application every minute, you must initialize it with a valid license key.
